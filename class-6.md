# Object-Oriented Programming, HTML Tables

*The notes below reference Jon Duckett “JavaScript & JQuery” (p.106-144), and "Domain Modeling" via Codefellows gitHub*

**What is domain modeling?**

Domain modeling is the process of creating a conceptual model in code for a specific problem. And a domain problem that's articulated well can verify your understanding of that problem.

**What is an Object-Oriented model?**

An entity that stores data in properties and behaviors in methods.

**How to learn to implement domain models in JavaScript?**

Write out and test your code so that you can remember how to implement doamin models in JS.

**How to define the same properties between many objects?**

Use a constructor function.

**Storing data within properties makes it possible for any new object to access that data later.**

**What is object-oriented programming in JavaScript?**

1. creating an object
2. initializing properties inside object using the `this` variable
3. store the object in a variable for later use

**What can a random number generator be used for?**

A random number generator can be used to model the random nature of user behavior.

**What function can be used to generate a random number?**

`Math.random()`

**Why use a prototype and what is it?**

A prototype is like an object's stunt double, you can use it to store methods. It is considered best practice in JavaScript to locate a method on the prototype object. In addition to that it allows two objects to share the same code, which makes a running program consume less memory. Consuming less memory is important for devices like smart phones and tablets.

**Tips to follow when building domain models**

1. Build self containted objects with the same properties and methods.
2. Model its properties with a constructor function that defines and initializes properties.
3. Model its behaviors with small methods that focus on doing one job well.
4. Create instances using the `new` keyword followed by a call to a constructor function.
5. Store the new object in a variable so that you can access its properties and methods from outside.
6. Use the `this` variable in your methods so you can access the object's properties and methods from inside.


**How to create an object using constructor notation:**
 
 `let car = new Object();`
 `car.name = 'Toyota';`
 `car.model = 'Prius';`
 `car.mileage = 400;`
 `car.milesPerGallon = 50;`
 `car.checkGasNeeded = function() {`
     `this.mileage/this.milesPerGallon;`
 `}`

 **To create an empty object using literal notation use:**
 `let car = {} (curly braces)`
*The curly braces create an empty object*

**How to update an object?**

- use dot notation or square brackets like this: hotel.name = 'Park';
- dot notation & square brackets work on objects created using literal or constructor notation
- to delete a property use the *delete* keyword like this: `delete hotel.name;`
- to clear the value of a property do this: `hotel.name = '';`

**How to create many objects**

Many objects can be created by using *Object Construtctor Notation*

**What is `this`?**

It is a keyword used inside of functions and objects. It always refers to one object!

**When is a function global?**

A function has a global scope when it is created at the top level of a script(not inside another object or function).

**When does a function become a method?**

When a function is defined inside of an object it becomes a method.

**How is data represnted in JavaScript?**

In JavaScript data is represented using name/value pairs.

**How can you organize your data in JavaScript?**

To organize your data, you can use an array or object to group a set of related values.

**What is a name also known as in arrays and objects?**

In arrays and objects the name is also known as a key.
