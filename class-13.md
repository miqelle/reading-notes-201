# CSS Transforms, Transitions, and Animations

One advanced feature of CSS is transformation, it allows you to change the positions and shapes of elements on a page.

Write a transform rule like this: 
`transform: value(argument);`

- Value is the type of transformation and argument is the extent to which the transformation is applied. Some transformation declarations can take multiple arguments.

- CSS transformations can be split into two categories, two-dimensional and three-dimensional.

- Two-dimensional CSS transformations operate on the X (horizontal) and Y (vertical) axes.

**CSS Transform: Translate**

- The translate() method translates, or moves, a page element up, down, left, and/or right on the page by a specified amount. In the parenthesis, the first number specifies the horizontal distance, and the second number specifies the vertical distance.
