# Chart.js, Canvas

**Canvas API**

Canvas is very much like the img attribute without the src and the alt in it, it runs on modern browsers and can include in it anything like audio, video, and simple pictures, it will be by default 300 pixels wide and 150 pixel high, but it can be modified using CSS,in order to avoid having a fallback content due old browsers not being able to run the canvas element we must provide the code with alternate content, so modern browsers will ignore the alternate content, and old browsers will ignore the canvas itself, and unlike the img tag canvas requires the closing tag < /canvas> otherwise the rest of the content will be considered fallback content and modern browsers will ignore it
Not only that but we can draw shapes with canvas like rectangles, paths, triangles, lines, arcs, and curves, as well as applying styles and colors and making them transparent or increase their line width, or line dashes, we can also use canvas to create line join, line cap and type of gradient concepts in addition to creating patterns and shadows or filling shapes canvas has a wide variety of real life applications that we can use not only drwaing but also styling texts like text filling, text stroking, text coloring and or control the text measurments, if you think about it, canvas is like an artists' canvas that gives you a blank page and allows you to show your creations on it.
