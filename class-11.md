# Chart.js, Canvas

CANVAS
canvas

The <canvas> element
The HTML <canvas> element is used to draw graphics, on the fly, via JavaScript.

It has only two attributes, width and height. These are both optional and can also be set using DOM properties.

When no width and height attributes are specified, the canvas will initially be 300 pixels wide and 150 pixels high.

The id attribute isn't specific to the <canvas> element but is one of the global HTML attributes which can be applied to any HTML element. It is always a good idea to supply an id because this makes it much easier to identify it in a script.

Fallback content
The <canvas> element differs from an <img> tag in that, like for <video>, <audio>, or <picture> elements, just insert the alternate content inside the <canvas> element. it also Required </canvas> tag.

The rendering context
The <canvas> element creates a fixed-size drawing surface that exposes one or more rendering contexts, which are used to create and manipulate the content shown.

The canvas is initially blank. To display something, a script first needs to access the rendering context and draw on it. has a method called getContext(), used to obtain the rendering context and its drawing functions.

lwt canvas = document.getElementById('test');
let x = canvas.getContext('2d');
Checking for support
lwt canvas = document.getElementById('test');
if (canvas.getContext) {
    let x = canvas.getContext('2d');
  // drawing code here
} else {
  // canvas-unsupported code here
}
Drawing shapes with canvas
The grid : HTML skeleton from the previous page had a canvas element 150 pixels wide and 150 pixels high.The origin of the grid is positioned in the top left corner at coordinate (0,0). All elements are placed relative to this origin.

Drawing rectangles
There are three functions that draw rectangles on the canvas:

fillRect(x, y, width, height) : Draws a filled rectangle.
strokeRect(x, y, width, height) : Draws a rectangular outline.
clearRect(x, y, width, height) : Clears the specified rectangular area, making it fully transparent.
Drawing paths
A path is a list of points, connected by segments of lines that can be of different shapes, curved or not, of different width and of different color.

To make shapes using paths:

beginPath() : Creates a new path.
Path methods : to set different paths for objects.
closePath() : Adds a straight line to the path, going to the start of the current sub-path.
stroke() : Draws the shape by stroking its outline.
fill() : Draws a solid shape by filling the path's content area.
For example to Drawing a triangle:

let triangle = canvas.getContext('2d');
    triangle.beginPath();
    triangle.moveTo(75, 50);
    triangle.lineTo(100, 75);
    triangle.lineTo(100, 25);
    triangle.fill();
Moving the pen
We could also use moveTo() to draw unconnected paths.

moveTo(x, y) Moves the pen to the coordinates specified by x and y.

Lines
For drawing straight lines, use the lineTo() method.

lineTo(x, y)

Arcs
To draw arcs or circles, we use the arc() or arcTo() methods.

arc(x, y, radius, startAngle, endAngle, counterclockwise)

arcTo(x1, y1, x2, y2, radius)

Note: Angles in the arc function are measured in radians, not degrees.

Drawing text
The canvas rendering context provides two methods to render text:

fillText(text, x, y [, maxWidth])

Fills a given text at the given (x,y) position. Optionally with a maximum width to draw.

strokeText(text, x, y [, maxWidth])

Strokes a given text at the given (x,y) position. Optionally with a maximum width to draw.

Styling text

font = value
textAlign = value
textBaseline = value
direction = value
Applying styles and colors

Chart.js
Charts are far better for displaying data visually than tables and have the added benefit that no one is ever going to press-gang them into use as a layout tool.

start with charts is with Chart.js, a JavaScript plugin that uses HTML5â€™s canvas element to draw the graph onto the page.

Drawing a line chart
create a canvas element in HTML in which Chart.js can draw the chart.
<canvas id="buy" width="500" height="300"></canvas>
write a script that will retrieve the context of the canvas.
<script>
    let buy = document.getElementById('buy').getContext('2d');
    new Chart(buy).Line(buyData);
</script>
Inside the same script, create the data.
var buyData = {
 labels : ["January","February","March","April","May","June"],
 datasets : [
  {
   fillColor : "rgba(172,194,132,0.4)",
   strokeColor : "#ACC26D",
   pointColor : "#fff",
   pointStrokeColor : "#9DB86D",
   data : [203,156,99,251,305,247]
  }
 ]
}
