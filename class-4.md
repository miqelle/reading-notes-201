# Images, Color, Text

- Images are added to a page by using the img tag
- *src* inside of the img tag tells the browser where it can find the image file
- *alt* is used to provide a text description about images
- `<figcaption>` can be used to add captions underneath a photo

# 3 Rules for Creating Images
1. Save images in the right format
2. Save images at the exact size you need them to be
3. Measure images in pixels 

- Opacity allows you to specify the opacity of an element, and it is a value between 0.0 and 1.0
- A value of 0.5 = 50% opacity and 0.15 = 15% opacity
- When picking foreground and background colors make sure there is enough contrast for the text to be readable

- A browser only shows a specific typeface if that typeface is installed on the user's computer
- Serif fonts have extra details on the end
- Sans- Serif fonts have straight ends
- Monospace has the same width on each letter
- Cursive fonts have joining strokes or other cursive characteristics
- Fantasy fonts are decorative and used for titles
- If you design on a Mac check how the typeface looks on a pc because a pc can render type less smoothly
- Font-family: specifies the typeface that should be used for all text
- Font- size: specifies font size for any element
- You can use px, %, or em to specify font size
- `:first-letter` and `:first-line` are pseudo-elements
- `:link`: allows you to set styles for links that have not yet been visited
- `:visited`: allows you to set styles for links that have been visited
