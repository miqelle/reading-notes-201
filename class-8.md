# Forms and JS Events

**What are forms used for?**

- To register as a member of a website

- To sign up for newsletters or mailing lists

**Form Controls**

- Text input
- Password Input
- Text Area
- Radio Buttons
- Checkboxes
- Drop-down boxes
- Submit buttons
- Upload buttons

**How forms work**

1. User fills in a form then presses a button to submit the info to the server
2. The name of each form control is sent to the server along with the value the user enters or selects
3. The server processes the info using a programming language such as PHP, C#, VB.net, or Java. It may also store the info in a database
4. The server creates an new page to send back to the browser based on the info received.

# Lists, Tables, and Forms

The list-style-type property allows you to control the shape or style of a bullet point. It can be used on rules that apply to the `<ol>, <ul>, and <li>` elements.

The list-style-image property allows you to specify an image to act as a bullet point. 

Table properties: width, padding, text-transform, letter-spacing, font-size, border-top, border-bottom, text-align, background-color, :hover

:hover can be used to highlight a table row when a user's mouse goes over it.
