# HTML Links, JS Functions, and Intro to CSS Layout

Links are created by using the `<a>` element, and users can click on anything between the opening and closing a tag. Links are super important because they allow web surfers to travel from one webpage to another with just a click of a link! When you are linking to other pages on the same site, you can use a relative URL. But to link to other sites must specify the domain name like this:"https//www.example.com". There are five relative link types and they are: Same Folder, Child Folder, Grandchild Folder, Parent Folder, and Grandparent Folder. To open a link in a new window just use a target attribute and set its value to "blank".

Layouts are another important topic when it comes to building a webpage. You will want to design for different sized screens, and control the position of the elements. For starters CSS treats each HTML element as if it is in it's own box. This box is either block-level or an inline-box. Block level boxes act as the main building block of any layout, and inline boxes flow between surrounding text. When a block level element is placed inside another block level element then the outer box is the container. It's common to place all header elements inside a div, and the div acts as the container. 

Furthermore, a lot of layouts place boxes next to each other. You can achieve this look, by using the float property. CSS Frameworks make the design process alot easier because they provide code for layout grids and styling forms. 

Now on to JavaScript. Functions, methods, and objects are used to organize code. Fuctions are a series of statements that perform a specific task. Methods work the same way as functions do, but they are created inside of objects. Objects are something a programmer can create, and they contain properties and methods. Also web browsers have built-in objects which are helpful when creating interactive webpages.
